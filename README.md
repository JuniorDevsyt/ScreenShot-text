# Screenshot-Text
***
1ยบ Project, in this project we are making a script that take the text of an screenshot, It's a simple code but this Readme is necessary because you have to install certain libraries.

## How it Works?
***
(The first time the program is run it will take a little longer since it will search for the paths it needs, the next times it will take less than 1 second).

- First, you have to take a screenshot.
- Then, it's necessary to run the executable of the proyect (The best thing to do this faster is creating a shortcut of the executable).
- The last thing we have to do its wait one second and the text will be in our clipboard ready to use it.

### IMPORTANT: The program must be run once everything is installed, otherwise there will be an error.

## What I need to Install?
***
- We need to install Pytesseract, here you have the link to get it. 
  In your shell write this command:
  
  ```
  $ pip install pytesseract
  ```
  Note: ( This is not the real tesseract)
  
  In this link you wil find the Tesseract to use it: 
  > https://github.com/UB-Mannheim/tesseract/wiki

- You must be sure that you have libraries like os or PIL, otherwise use:

```
  $ pip install numpy
  $ pip install os-win
  $ pip install Pillow
  $ pip install pyperclip3
  $ pip install pyperclip
  $ pip install PySimpleGUI
  $ pip install pycopy-fnmatch 
  $ pip install fnmatch2
  $ pip install io
  $ pip install --upgrade pywin32
  $ pip install pyautogui
  $ pip install cv2
  
  ```
  ~Made with python version >= python 3.9
  We hope you enjoy it!
  Have a good code!
